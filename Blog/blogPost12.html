        <h3>CSS and its relationship with HTML and JS</h3>
        <p>
            CSS is a powerful tool when it comes to the styling of the webpage, very apparent from the transition from plain text to styled text.
            Within my own webpage, I've learnt that HTML and its microformating for declaring classes is important for css to understand where to apply what styling.
            Along with is the use of ids, for css to target specific elements above all else.
            When it comes to Javascript and css, I view it like a hammer and a nail, javascript can hammer many things, and a nail can be put in anywhere,
            but using javascript to manipulate css to create fluid and dynamic elements works best.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits and Challenges of responsive design</h3>
        <p>
            Using responsive design comes with great benefits, the main being that the website is interesting, not just text,
            as well as the user being able to understand what the page and they, are meant to do, simply by using the page.
            However, responsive design comes at the cost of many things, one being digital cost. Responsive design uses more of the users device and their data,
            resulting in possibly a slow and unresponsive experience. There is also the risk of overstimulation, especially when it comes to colourful and visual elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Decolonialism</h3>
        <p>
            One of the main things that come to mind in decolonialising coding practice is the use of terms like "master" and "slave" elements,
            however I have never had personaly experience with such terms in code, so I have not the need to avoid what I do not use.
