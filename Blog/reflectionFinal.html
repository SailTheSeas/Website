            Looking back, there are many things I wish I understood better earlier on, like using javascript variables better and functions better, but here we are, and overall,
            my javascript is used well. I did use it to make whole pages alot, rather than assign functions to preexisting components.

            With my css, I think my desktop version looks great, and my two other smaller form factors look alright. I wish I could have tested the tablet size with an actual tablet device,
            as I feel that would better communicate the changes over emulating the form factor in a web browser. My font size on mobile is a bit too small, 
            I would like to have spent further time fine tuning it.

            With my portfolio pages, I am incredibly happy with how the content is visually displayed, and although the idea of a zoom function for the fullscreen mode,
            the fact that I had to compress my pictures for a better page load time, deterred me. Otherwise, all the features I wanted for my portfolio pages were implemented.

            With my main page, I had hoped to make it dynamically change with scrolling, but decided against it, due to the complexity of such an implementation, 
            and how soon to deadline I had felt the desire to implement such a feature.

            I'm disappointed with my blogs, they started out strong, but I fell behind with them and wrote short shallow works to catch up.
