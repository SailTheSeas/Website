            Although the internet has made the world a smaller place, "Towars a study of information geographies" shows that that this effect is not global.
            The fact that many of the global south still struggle to use and gain access to these technologies is of no surprise, as much of it is reliant on prebuilt infrastructure
            and the websites need to be designed to be used in your native tounge. Due to developing nature of these countries, they do not have the people in place to design localised versions of websites,
            which further stifles they development in the digital world.
