        <h3>Javacript and considerations</h3>
        <p>
            The main changes done to my website for javascript focused on my portfolio. Turning the main index page into a responsive element with the users interaction,
            as well as building each portfolio page using javascript so that the different sets of pictures need not be loaded in manually.
            However, in looking to add javascript to the website, a major hurdle was that many javascript implementations are reliant on css to work fluidly,
            such as a sticky index, which was an element I wanted to add but had to postpone till css was allowed.

            Javascript is a powerful tool however, as I found that I could add functions to change the page dynamically,
            like resizing images when the user hovered over or for a button to take the user to the top of the page.
