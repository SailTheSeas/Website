        <h2>Reflection: CSS</h2>
        <p>
            CSS was a wonerful experience, finally being able to implement the designs that we have been working on. With javascript the challenges faced were logical problems,
            with css it was about visual problems, how to place elements for each form factor so that they would fit just right. Lots of tweaking was needed and done,
            but the page inspector made that quick and painless.

            Another element taken into consideration was the picture size for the portfolio, for two reasons, one being load time and the other data usage.
            Bigger pictures (in regards to files size), would take longer to load and would use more data from the user. For this, the images were compressed down,
            however more compression may be needed.
