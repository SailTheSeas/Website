        <h3>The internet and ethics</h3>
        <p>
            To me, for the internet to be an ethical space, it would be one where no misinformation could exist, which is a plague on our modern society.
            A place where opinion can be shared without harsh judgement, so long as the opinions are not hateful and harmful.
            A place where one can gain any information, but not that that would be used for nefarious reasons, nor to invade someones privacy.
            A place where one can connect to anyone else in the world and be able to learn about them and their life and culture and vice versa, but not put ones own safety at risk.
            We are close to these many things, but we as a species are our own worst enemy. Many online spaces are incredibly toxic and even discriminatory,
            for every cute and sweet online interaction there are two more horrific ones.
            Corporate greed and government spying has resulted in many spaces where the users are fearful to be honest, as well as created echo chambers to fuel misinformation and bigotry.
            The greatest benefit of the internet is that is has made it apparent how wide the gap is between the "developed" and the "developing" world,
            and how it does not seem as though they want that gap to be narrowed.
