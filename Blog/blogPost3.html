        <h3>Website Design</h3>
        <p>
            The website should be built for mobile and desktop use, for the widest reach possible. Since the purpose of the website is to hold my portfolio while also acting as a display of my UI and UX skills, the website needs to be reliable and work well, as well as be easily navigable and flashy. It also needs to pitch my work to make an immediate impact, first impressions and all. The first of my plans for this is to have a background made up of the best parts of my short films as the first thing you see when you open the main page.
            From there you can scroll down through a brief "blurb" of who I am and what I do. With my portfolio page I want to break it down into sections, starting with photography, then filmography and then my game projects and code projects, with an index at the top of the page to easily jump to each section.
            The idea with this placement stems from the fact that I think this website will be more likely used to pitch web design or my photography, rather than coding skills, as companies usually prefer to know you can learn their systems, rather than care about your projects.

            With this portfolio page, I want my photography section to use large thumbnails with text over them as the "buttons" to go to that specific faucet of photography, the idea being that the person can just look for what type of pictures they need to check out, such as portraits, where they would just look for a picture of a person and in the case of where they may be unsure, they will see the label on the image.
            Maybe having the label fade in when you hover over the image would work even better.

            Going back to the main page, I would like to have the pages bar scroll with the page, so that there is ease of access to the rest of the site at all times. Something that I think would look cool and fit with the more game design aspect of my portfolio is having a loading bar below the page bar, that will indicate the how far to the bottom of the page you are. Providing a general sense of how long the introduction is, as well as showcasing some more design capabilities. With my main page being my About page, I plan to not have a dedicated one.
            Throughout the main page I will have a variety of my photos or screenshots of my games, as well as maybe including some code for a basic algorithm.
            Something that allows the user to input a value and get a result back. Like code that reverses the words in a sentence, but more complicated.
        </p>
        <h3>Structure, Schemes and Semantic Markup</h3>
        <p>
            I believe the structure of my website hasn't changed much and only enforces the semantic design of it.
            Since each portfolio is split into its own folder, navigating through a thumbnail of the photo to the said portfolio makes sense intuitively.
            Along with that, the base idea of it being my "ship" fits with the idea of the many sections.
            If I want to theme it even more I could have different pages have specific names, like the main page the deck, each portfolio a cabin and so on.
            I will see if this idea is good.
        </p>


        <h3>Progress Report</h3>
        <p>
            I've worked on trying out some stuff for my portfolio, I know it is not required for the first assignment, but I wanted to test some ideas, such as having a cover photo dedicated to each photo genre.
            I have also made sure to keep up with my blog updates.
